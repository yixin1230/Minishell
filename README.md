## About

A project made in accordance with the Minishell project which is part of the Codam Core Curriculum.
The shell is a program that interacts with the user through a terminal or takes the input from a file and executes a sequence of commands that are passed to the Operating System. I am going to write my own shell program.

## Starting
```bash

# Compile the mandatory part
make

# To remove objects
make clean

# To remove objects and executable
make fclean
```
